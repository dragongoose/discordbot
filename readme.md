# Untitled Discord Bot

UDB is a discord bot that I made to do everything I needed in my discord server, all in one.

## Starting

Once in the project diretory, you are going to make a config file.

Once you create config.json, you are going to need to add these entries

```json
{
    "token": "DISCORD TOKEN",
    "mongooseConnectionString": "MONGODBURL",
    "prefix": "PREFIX",
    "urbanapikey": "RAPID-API-URBAN-DICT-KEY",
    "openweathermap": "OPEN WEATHER MAP TOKEN",
    "ownerid": "OWNERID"
}

```

After you all all of the information needed into config.json, 
you will need to install dependencies by doing `npm install`.
After you install dependencies, you are ready to start the bot!
You can start the bot by running `node index` in the projects directory.
